# Password-Generator

🚀 Built a Secure & Customizable Password Generator! 🔑💻

As a software engineering student, I'm always looking for ways to enhance my front-end skills while solving real-world problems. Recently, I developed a password generator that allows users to create strong passwords based on their preferences!

🔹 Features:
✅ Choose character length
✅ Include/exclude uppercase, lowercase, numbers & symbols
✅ Dynamic UI updates & real-time strength indication
✅ One-click copy to clipboard

👨‍💻 Tech Stack: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
This project improved my problem-solving approach, especially in randomization algorithms and DOM manipulation.

💡 What do you think? Would love to hear your feedback! 😊
